## *Verification for Sellers:*

* At least three (3) color pictures (no filters) of you holding a timestamp while wearing socks on your feet. Timestamp is required to be clearly written and will be checked for photoshopping by mods before verification!

* A fourth (4th) timestamped picture of socks on top of a counter with a Fork on the left, Spoon on the right, and Knife on the top. (This **DOES NOT** need to be updated with each new sale of socks... just a picture of your *FIRST* pair of socks you would like to sell)

* If you already are verified through another trustworthy sub (such as /r/gonewild), please cross-post your original verification album **along with the sock/cutlery picture** to MODMail.

**All conditions have to be satisfied for you to be verified and for any selling related posts to be approved. Verified Sellers are also verified to post any non-selling "self" images.**

## *Verification for Buyers:*

* Account must be at least 1 week old

* Must have buying rep on another sub (send a message to MODMail with a link to a post of yours showing flair)

* If you want to be a Verified Buyer and have no other purchases contact us via modmail and we will see what we can do to help you out.

**All conditions have to be satisfied for you to be verified**

##*Verification for Posters:*

* At least three (3) color pictures (no filters) of you holding a timestamp while wearing socks on your feet. Timestamp is required to be clearly written and will be checked for photoshopping by mods before verification!

* If you already are verified through another trustworthy sub (such as /r/gonewild), there is no need for new pictures.  Please send the verification album to MODMail.

* If you are verified to post only your sock pictures/videos you ***ARE NOT*** verified to sell your socks in our sub!

**All conditions have to be satisfied for you to be verified. Posting will still be allowed, but posts may be subject to removal pending MOD review.**

***Redditors verified for "self" posts will not be allowed to sell until "SELLER VERIFICATION" conditions have been met.***

###### **WHAT IS A TIMESTAMP?**

It is a small, handwritten sign that ***MUST*** include the following:

1. Your *exact* reddit username  
2. Today's date (must match the date you submit the post)  
3. A mention of reddit or /r/TheSockDrawer so that we know this verification was intended for use here on reddit.  
4. The handwritten sign must be crumpled up and then unfolded.  

Verification process is done by hand and might take up to 2 days depending on the queue length.
